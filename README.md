### **Welcome to my Blog!**

I'm Kelli, a Doctoral Student in Environmental Science & Engineering at UCLA with a passion for integrating sustainability into healthcare practices. With a strong foundation in both direct patient care and biotechnology, I am committed to leveraging my diverse skill set to drive positive change in both patient outcomes and environmental impact.

My journey in the field began with a Bachelor's degree in Chemistry from Westfield State, followed by a Master's in Biotechnology from Northeastern University. This educational background, coupled with over three years of hands-on experience in clinical laboratories, has equipped me with a robust understanding of molecular and chemical techniques in CLIA and BSL-2 environments.

Previously, I served as a Senior Research Associate at Foundation Medicine, where I contributed to the Assay Development team, gaining invaluable insights into innovative technologies and methodologies. My expertise spans automation development, PCR, LDTs, DNA/RNA extraction, and NGS library preparation across platforms like Ion Torrent, Illumina, and Oxford Nanopore.

Driven by a desire to make a tangible difference, I aspire to become a Chief Sustainability Officer, leading initiatives that prioritize both patient care and environmental stewardship. I thrive in dynamic environments, embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and innovation.

I believe in the power of collaboration and am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share my vision of a more sustainable and equitable future.

Let's connect and explore how we can work together to create meaningful impact in healthcare and beyond!
